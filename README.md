# Cross-device-Portability-for-EMSCA
This repository contains the detailed expermient of the cross-device portability of forensic insight acquistion using EMSCA for the smartphones and IoT devices.
This experiment involves in applying the existing machine learning model to the number of EM traces which are collected multiple times from same devices and different devices:
  1. iPhone Models
  2. Nordic Semiconductor
